    This dataset contains the tweet ids of approximately 280 million tweets
    related to the 2016 United States presidential election. They were collected
    between July 13, 2016 and November 10, 2016 from the Twitter API using
    Social Feed Manager.

    These tweet ids are broken up into 12 collections. Each collection was
    collected either from the GET statuses/user_timeline method of the Twitter
    REST API or the POST statuses/filter method of the Twitter Stream API. The
    collections are:

    * Candidates and key election hashtags (Twitter filter): 
      election-filter[1-6].txt
    * Democratic candidates (Twitter user timeline):
      democratic-candidate-timelines.txt
    * Democratic Convention (Twitter filter):
      democratic-convention-filter.txt 
    * Democratic Party (Twitter user timeline):
      democratic-party-timelines.txt 
    * Election Day (Twitter filter):
      election-day.txt 
    * First presidential debate (Twitter filter):
      first-debate.txt
    * GOP Convention (Twitter filter):
      republican-convention-filter.txt
    * Republican candidates (Twitter user timeline):
      republican-candidate-timelines.txt
    * Republican Party (Twitter user timeline):
      republican-party-timelines.txt

      second-debate.txt
    * Third presidential debate (Twitter filter):
      third-debate.txt
    * Vice Presidential debate (Twitter filter):

    There is also a README.txt file for each collection containing additional
    documentation on how it was collected.
