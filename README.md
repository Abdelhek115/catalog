3. Create a new dataset entry by following the example of others in the file.

If all of this sounds too complicated don't give up. You can also create an
issue in our [issue tracker] that minimally includes the URL for the dataset.
Someone on the team will then edit [datasets.yaml] for you.

If you have ideas or suggestions about the metadata or want to help design the 
website please send along those pull requests and issues too.
